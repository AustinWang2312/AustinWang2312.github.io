                Crafted a video game from scratch in Unity (C#) with a full ideation process for designing gameplay mechanics and outlining remaining patches for the game. Assets were created from scratch using Midjourney AI, the sound effects were normalized and adjusted in Audacity, and animations were developed in the Unity editor. The game is a top-down 2D rogue-like where the player is a spell caster who combines Earth, Fire, and Water orbs to synthesize unique spells to protect themselves against waves of enemies. At the moment, the game exists only as a demo version and is not complete.

Users can create various calendars and guides, or add existing ones. Any user can also share their content, either privately with friends, or publicly with the whole world!  People can also search for public calendars and guides, and also browse calendars that they may be interested in.

                <div style="margin: 20px;">
                Designed an atmospheric sushi bar setting using the TinyGraphics Javascript framework. Users can interact with the sushi bar by requesting more sushi, placing it where they want on the table, and finally consuming it. All textures and models were self designed. Lighting and shadows as well as alternative camera angles are also implemented to improve the graphical realism. Mouse picking and object collision are used to prevent sushi trays from colliding.

Lyricloud scrapes music lyrics from Genius.com and converts them to a WordCloud format using the react-wordcloud module. The backend server performs the webscraping and text processing while the frontend calls the server's API to retrieve the relevant lyrics. WORK IN PROGRESS. To be implemented: smart searches, webscraping lyrics from backup websites, support for foreign languages, handling for songs with multiple artists, Wordcloud generation for multiple songs.

A few of the selected features included Brand, total sales, prior sales, rolling average sales, units sold, rolling average units sold, average retail price, variety (amount of cannabis categories a brand sells), and product count. Multiple models were then tested using R^2, MAE, MSE, RMSE and kfold cross validation for evaluation. The models tested included Linear regression with Lasso and Ridge, Linear regression with TruncatedSVD (dimensionality reduction), AdaBoost with TruncatedSVD, Regression Tree w/wo Truncated SVD and BaggingRegressor.

Each server accepts TCP connections from "mobile clients" which can share location data to the servers. Clients can also request the places nearby another client's most recent location using the Google Places API with an HTTP GET (using aiohttp). Client location data is propagated to each server and the server herd should continue to operate even in the event of one server shutting down.

            A simple router was created that would function similarly to a real router by receiving packets, processing them, and forwarding them to the correct interface via longest-prefix matching lookups in a routing table. The router ran on top of Mininet which allowed me to emulate a network topology on a single machine. The router was able to handle ethernet frames, IPv4 packets and ICMP packets and also verify packets via checksum/length while discarding invalid packets.

            Used BeautifulSoup to parse CNN articles and count keywords. Given a specific date, the algorithm could count the most used keywords across all articles for the day. These wordcounts could then be used as features for a linear regression for calculating stock price. For example, the number of times "recession" is mentioned in a day could be of note. Combined with historic stock data from Yahoo Finance, these features were used in a linear regressor (sklearn) to estimate stock prices in the future for any given stock.

Routing was calculated from point to point using the A* search algorithm to minimize distance travelled.

Instructions for a driver were then generated with turn by turn navigation provided for them.

            <h2 >Performance Analysis of Python Packages</h2>
            <div style="margin: 20px;">
            A comprehensive performance analysis was conducted of multiple scientific Python packages (Numpy, Nengo, Astropy, Sympy) using available open source benchmark suites. Tools used include Air Speed Velocity (ASV) which benchmarks python projects over their lifetime, Cprofile which counts CPU cycles and where they're used, Perf which also displays cycle usage and distribution, and Top which allowed me to measure CPU utilization. The Python Benchmark Suite was another more comprehensive benchmark that was tested. Comparisons were drawn between the performance of the default Cpython and the PyPy Interpreter which my team at Intel was currently studying.
