    I'm an ambitious software engineer who's currently looking for an opportunity to work together with other focused individuals to put together something special. I love working in backend development and working close with the actual data and algorithms, but I also have enthusiasm for elegant ui design. My resume is attached below.

    I'm a student at UCLA involved with UPE UCLA's CS Honor society and UCLA Wushu (Chinese Martial Art). I'm currently the social chair for UCLA Wushu and it's always a blast to get to train and hangout with such a tight knit group of friends. In my free time, I also like to play casual pickup volleyball and go hiking and read.
